# Reciv-Rebuilt
A rebuild of SpacedOutChicken's Deciv Redux, a rescue of 9kgsofrice's Deciv.

#The Premise
This is a rebuild of Deciv Redux, but throws human civilisation all the way back to stone age technology. The basic premise is that some alien civilisation used world war 3 as an excuse to strategically bomb major population centers and military bases. The resulting fallout killed hundreds of millions, and the nuclear winter that followed killed at least a billion. Those few who survived became nomads, wandering the earth, following the migratory animals to the few remaing green spaces in the worlld.

Two hundred years have passed, and those nomadic tribes are noticing the end of the long winter, and are ready to settle down and rebuild a civilisation.

#The Project
In order to do all the things I would like to do with this mod, I'll need to submit a lot of pull requests to Unciv main, focussing on updating and expanding the uniques attatched to units and tile improvements, and adding more flexibility to the logic that the game uses to run civilisations.

Because I don't have any programming experience, this part of the project will undoubtedly take quite some time, particularly because those pull requests might be rejected, in which case I'll have to build uot my own fork of Unciv, which take much longer.
